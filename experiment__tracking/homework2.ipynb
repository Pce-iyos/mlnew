    "The results from the hyperparameter optimization are quite good. So, we can assume that we are ready to test some of these models in production. In this exercise, you'll promote the best model to the model registry. We have prepared a script called register_model.py, which will check the results from the previous step and select the top 5 runs. After that, it will calculate the RMSE of those models on the test set (March 2023 data) and save the results to a new experiment called random-forest-best-models.\n",
